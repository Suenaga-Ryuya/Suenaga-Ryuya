# Hi, I'm RyuyaðŸ‘‹

## :frowning_person: About Me
I am a software engineer.

I always try to experience whatever I can because there are many things to know in the world.<br/>
And also to communicate with people, that's most important thing for me!

Please feel free to ask about anything!<br/>
I am greatful to open your community and communicate with each other!

What I like is...
- :keyboard: Customizing keyboards, especially, keycaps and keyswitches.
- :airplane: Travel. I like the beautiful scenery. I am comfortable in nature.
- :dog: Animals. I am with my daughter (dog) :) She is the Shiba inu.

etc.

### **_- Desktop tool for operating excel and csv files with some languages_**
This is the first project I joined.<br/>
In this project, we mainly use excel, csv and google spread sheet manually.

It was unefficient, so I had been developing efficiency tools by myself to create files automatically.
